    <h3>The outlook for snowpack in 2025 is limited to cumulative snowpack through February 2, an imperfect predictor of SWE in April. Thus far, winter storms have created abundant snowpack in northern California and much of Oregon, but conditions in the Central and Southern Sierra Nevada of California are below median. Much of Washington and Idaho are experiencing median snowpack or worse.</h3>    <img src="Snow_Water_Equivalent_map.jpeg" alt = "Image showing Snowpack: Snow water equivalent in WA, OR, CA and ID as of February 2, 2025, relative to the 1991-2020 median.
