    <h3>Data from the central area of the nearly coastwide RREAS survey showed a fairly productive ecosystem, with juvenile rockfishes and anchovy continuing to dominate the forage community, a moderate abundance of alternative forage, and very few taxa at low abundance levels. Notably, the survey observed very high abundances of YOY rockfish (at the highest level since the 2015-2016 marine heatwave), the continued above-average abundance of adult northern anchovies, and slightly above-average krill abundance.</h3>
