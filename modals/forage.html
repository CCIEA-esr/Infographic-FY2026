    <h3>The ichthyoplankton assemblage from spring CalCOFI larval fish surveys in 2025 was similar to assemblages in 2017-24, and continued to reflect elevated abundances of larval rockfishes, larval anchovy, northern lampfish, and southern mesopelagics. Catches of larval anchovy in spring 2025 remained below the record level in 2022 but were still at a historically high level in 2025. Similarly, larval California smoothtongue (a mesopelagic species) show a strong, downward, short-term trend but their abundance is still well above the time series average. Other species declined compared to the previous year to near average levels (Pacific hake, slender sole, jack mackerel, eared blacksmelt). Market squid paralarvae, which were absent in 2023 and 2024, increased significantly to the second highest abundance in the time series. Catches of larval flatfishes and southern mesopelagic were also high. In contrast, larval rockfishes were well below average in 2025, exhibiting a sharp decline relative to record high levels in recent years. Larval sardines have been low since 2012 and remained low in 2025. Recent trends for most species or species groups were significant.</h3>
