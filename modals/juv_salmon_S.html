    <h3>Catches of juvenile coho and Chinook salmon from June surveys in the Northern CCE are indicators of salmon survival during their first few weeks at sea. Catch-per-unit-effort of yearling Chinook salmon in 2025 was once again close to the time series average. Catches of yearling coho salmon were the highest in the 28-year time series and suggest an increasing five-year trend in their early marine survival.</h3>
