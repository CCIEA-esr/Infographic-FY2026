    <h3>Dungeness crab tissues (viscera and meat) remained below regulatory thresholds in Oregon and Washington in 2025; however, the opening of the 2025-2026 commercial fishery was delayed in both States due to low meat recovery. Exceedances in the viscera and meat of Dungeness crab were detected in northern California in the fall of 2025, delaying the opening of the recreational Dungeness crab fishery. California’s commercial Dungeness crab fishery was delayed due to marine life entanglement risk and meat quality testing, with meat quality tests unable to be completed due to the domoic acid event in northern California. This year marks the seventh consecutive year that the commercial Dungeness crab fishery has been delayed in California because of marine life entanglement risk concerns, and the first year that the fishery operated under some sort of restriction for the entire season.</h3>
