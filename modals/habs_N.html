    <h3>Pseudo-nitzschia HABs can cost tens of millions of dollars in lost revenue, particularly for the commercial Dungeness crab fishery, and cause a range of sociocultural impacts in fishing communities. This figure shows a summary of management actions in the commercial Dungeness crab fishery in response to domoic acid and other issues, such as poor body condition and marine life entanglement risk. Since the massive 2015-16 HAB event, domoic acid contamination requiring evisceration or delay of the opening of the season has mostly impacted the fishery in Oregon and Washington. Management actions related to marine life entanglement risk (spatial closures, gear or depth restrictions) or poor crab body condition have occurred in all three states, and have largely overshadowed domoic acid related management actions in California since 2019.</h3>    <img src="HABS-dcrab-closures-simple.png" alt = "Image showing Harmful Algal Blooms - Crab Closures: The spatial-temporal history of closures and management restrictions in the U.S. West Coast Dungeness crab fishery from 2015 to 2024, both HAB and non-HAB related.
