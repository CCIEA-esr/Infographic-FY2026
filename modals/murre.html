    <h3>In 2025, seabird indicators reflected generally favorable conditions for breeding in the Central and Northern CCE, with most species recovering from relatively lower productivity in 2024. Late winter upwelling may have pre-conditioned the system, through early productivity, to facilitate higher spring reproductive success.</h3>
    <img src="2025 CCE Seabird Report Card.png" alt="Image showing Seabird productivity - SE Farallon Island: Seabird population productivity, as measured through indicators of reproductive success, tracks marine environmental conditions and often reflects forage production near breeding colonies. We monitor and report on standardized anomalies of fledgling production per pair of breeding adults for multiple seabird species at Destruction Island, Washington and Yaquina Head, Oregon in the Northern CCE and Southeast Farallon Island in the Central CCE. Collectively, these focal species span a range of breeding parameters, feeding habits, and ways of provisioning their chicks, and thus provide a broad picture of the status of marine conditions.
