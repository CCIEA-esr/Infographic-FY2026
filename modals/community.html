    <h3>Puget Sound, Newport, Crescent City and Eureka port groups closed major processor facilities in 2024. Concurrently, we saw an increase in the port-level revenue concentration for the groundfish-sector coastwide, and a loss of groundfish as a significant and connected fishery in affected Oregon and California ports.</h3>    <img src="?" alt = "Image showing Community Vulnerability - Fishing Reliance: Commercial fishing per capita engagement and social vulnerability scores (left) and recreational fishing per capita engagement and social vulnerability scores (right) in 2022 for communities in Washington, Oregon, and northern, central and southern California.
