    <h3>Overall, 2025 saw average levels of total cumulative upwelling within the Southern California Bight (39°N). The reduction in total upwelling was related to a delay in the upwelling season due to the influence of El Niño. Upwelling resumed in pulses after the spring delay, suggesting average productivity in this region during the summer of 2024.</h3>
