    <h3>Snowpack supported freshwater resources for much of the Pacific Coast. By the end of the water year in September 2024, only 11% of California was experiencing at least moderate drought conditions (D1 or higher levels of the U.S. Drought Monitor index), down from a high of nearly 100% in 2022. Where water scarcity existed, it generally was not severe: over 95% of the Pacific west experienced moderate drought conditions (D1) or better.</h3>
