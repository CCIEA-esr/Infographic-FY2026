    <h3>Blooms of the diatom genus Pseudo-nitzschia can produce domoic acid, a toxin that can affect coastal food webs and lead to fishery closures. In 2024, such blooms occurred along the entire West Coast throughout much of the summer, but they were most problematic for shellfish fisheries and marine life in California and southern Oregon. A large marine mammal stranding event related to a Pseudo-nitzschia bloom and domoic acid occurred in southern California from July to August, with a resurgence in September. This marks the third consecutive year that this region has witnessed such an event.</h3>    <img src="sea-lion-with-domoic-acid.jpg" alt = "Image showing Harmful Algal Blooms - Marine Mammals: California sea lion showing symptoms of domoic acid poisoning.
