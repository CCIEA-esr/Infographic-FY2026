    <h3>Data from the “Core Area” of the nearly coastwide RREAS survey that targets pelagic YOY rockfishes, and samples other pelagic species showed YOY rockfishes and Pacific hake were highly abundant during 2024. Notably, catches of YOY rockfishes were at their highest abundances relative to the past several years.</h3>    <img src="Forage_C_ts_appendix-1.png" alt = "Image showing Groundfish recruitment: Catch per unit area (mean ln(delta-GLM index +1) and 95% CL) anomalies of a subset of key forage groups in the Core Area of the Central California Current Ecosystem (CCE) Rockfish Recruitment and Ecosystem Assessment Survey (RREAS), 1990 - 2024.
