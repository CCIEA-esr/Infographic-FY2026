    <h3>Overall, 2025 saw above average to above average levels of total cumulative upwelling in the central region off of northern California(~39°N). The year began with unusually large pulses of upwelling during January, before switching to a period of downwelling in March, followed  by more upwelling in early April. Upwelling remained fairly average for most of the summer, except for a few occasional relaxation events at mid-latitudes (from 36-42 °N), before transitioning to a mostly downwelling state through the fall starting in late August/early September.</h3>
