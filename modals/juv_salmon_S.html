    <h3>Catches of juvenile coho and Chinook salmon from June surveys in the Northern CCE are indicators of salmon survival during their first few weeks at sea. Catch-per-unit-effort of yearling Chinook salmon in 2025 was once again close to the time series average. Catches of yearling coho salmon were the highest in the 28-year time series and suggest an increasing five-year trend in their early marine survival. Juvenile rockfish are a key prey item of juvenile coho (Daly et al. 2013) and their abundance has also increased in the Northern CCE in recent years.</h3>    <img src="salmon-juvenile-ts-1.png" alt = "Image showing Salmon, Juvenile outmigration - CA: Stoplight charts of indicators key to the recruitment of Sacramento River fall Chinook salmon (SRFC), Central Valley spring Chinook salmon (CVSC), and Klamath River Fall Chinook salmon (KRFC) stocks.
