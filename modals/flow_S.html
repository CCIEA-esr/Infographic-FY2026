    <h3>In the southern ecoregions, streamflow conditions were close to median levels in 2025. Maximum and minimum river flow patterns tended to follow spatial patterns in snowpack, with California ecoregions above median levels. Five-year trends of both streamflow indicators were trending in a positive direction in the south. Minimum stream flows were near or slightly above average to the south, generally reflecting snowpack levels from the start of the 2025 water year. Maximum stream flows were also near or slightly above average to the south, except for the southern California bight, which was lower than average.</h3>
