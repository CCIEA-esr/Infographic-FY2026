    <h3>Overall, 2024 saw average levels of total cumulative upwelling in the north (Newport, OR; 45°N). The reduction in total upwelling was related to a delay in the upwelling season due to the influence of El Niño. During the summer, there were also several periods of significant upwelling relaxation, or even downwelling.</h3>    <img src="Upwelling45N.png" alt = "Image showing Upwelling 45N: Daily estimates of vertical transport of water (CUTI, left) and nitrate (BEUTI, right) in 2024, relative to the 1988-2024 climatological average (blue dashed line) +1 s.d.
