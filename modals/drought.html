    <h3>By the end of the water year in September 2025, almost 65% of the western region of the US was experiencing at least moderate drought conditions (D1 or higher levels of the U.S. Drought Monitor index). At the end of December 2025, midway through the 2026 water year, only 41% of the region was experiencing moderate drought conditions; the entire state of California had completely exited any sort of drought status for the first time in 25 years, and down from a high of nearly 100% in 2022.</h3>
