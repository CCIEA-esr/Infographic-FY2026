    <h3>In the all three of the northern ecoregions, maximum and minimum river flow patterns within rivers were well below median levels in 2025, generally reflecting snowpack levels from the start of the 2025 water year in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. Five-year trends of both streamflow indicators were trending more negative in the northern ecoregions. Minimum stream flows were generally lower than average to the north, with the Columbia Glaciated region continued its trend of decreasing minimum flow. Maximum stream flows were generally lower than average to the north, with the Salish Sea and WA Coast ecoregion showing a declining 5-year trend in 1-day maximum flows.</h3>
