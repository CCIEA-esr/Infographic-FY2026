    <h3>West Coast entanglement reports in 2025 remained below the peak years of 2015-2018 and were less than the number of confirmed reports in 2024. Humpback whales continued to be the most common species reported. Late-summer and early-fall increases in habitat compression and a nearshore increase in adult anchovy (a main prey of humpback whales) may have both contributed to increased entanglement risk and possibly the likelihood of detections overall. Most reports were in California, with an increase in reports in Washington compared to previous years.</h3>    <img src="whale-entanglements-selected-1.png" alt = "Image showing Whale Entanglement: Numbers of reported entanglements for selected species (alive and dead) in fishing gear along the West Coast from 2000 - 2024.
