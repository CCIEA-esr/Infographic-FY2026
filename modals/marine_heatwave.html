    <h3>The northeast Pacific continues to experience large marine heatwaves in surface waters. At the beginning of the year, the El Niño dominated the patterns in ocean temperatures, until it subsided in mid April. Separate from the El Niño, another large marine heatwave developed in the far offshore region (>1000km) during late April, grew during the summer, and reached its maximum size (~6 million km2) on September 3rd. It was the 6th largest heatwave by area and the 5th longest in duration since monitoring began in 1982, although it is still ongoing. Similar to 2023, this year’s heatwave had several large intrusions into the coastal areas.</h3>
