    <h3>Puget Sound, Newport, Crescent City and Eureka port groups closed major processor facilities in 2024. Concurrently, we saw an increase in the port-level revenue concentration for the groundfish-sector coastwide, and a loss of groundfish as a significant and connected fishery in affected Oregon and California ports.</h3>
