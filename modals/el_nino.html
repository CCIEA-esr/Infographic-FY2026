    <h3>Basin-scale indices suggest average to below-average conditions for productivity in 2024. The ONI was positive during the beginning of the year and indicative of El Niño conditions, with a shift towards negative at the end of the year, whereas the PDO and NPGO were negative during the entire year. Although the PDO remained negative for a 5th consecutive year, it shifted towards more positive values during the early part of the year, in concert with the El Niño. After reaching relatively neutral values during parts of 2021 and 2022, the NPGO has remained negative since then, indicating weaker than average general circulation.</h3>
