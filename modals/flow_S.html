    <h3>Across ecoregions, conditions within rivers were close to median levels in 2024. Maximum and minimum river flow patterns tended to follow spatial patterns in snowpack, with California ecoregions above median levels. Five-year trends suggested a latitudinal cline, with both streamflow indicators trending more positive in the south.</h3>    <img src="freshwater-streamflow_south.png" alt = "Image showing Stream Flow South Ecoregions: Anomalies of 7-day minimum and 1-day maximum streamflow measured at 213 gages in three southern ecoregions (OR & northern CA coast, Sacramento-San Joaquin, southern CA Bight) from 1990-2024.
