    <h3>Snowpack supported freshwater resources for much of the Pacific Coast, although a dry summer in the Pacific Northwest somewhat exacerbated water scarcity. By the end of the water year in September 2024, 55% of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho was experiencing at least moderate drought conditions (D1 or higher levels of the U.S. Drought Monitor index). Where water scarcity existed, it generally was not severe: over 95% of the Pacific west experienced moderate drought conditions (D1) or better.</h3>    <img src="freshwater-SWE_north.png" alt = "Image showing Snowpack North: Anomalies of April 1st snow-water equivalent (SWE) in three of the northern freshwater ecoregions of the CCE, 1990-2024.
