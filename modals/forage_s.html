    <h3>The ichthyoplankton assemblage from spring CalCOFI larval fish surveys in 2024 was similar to assemblages in 2017-23, and continued to reflect elevated abundances of larval rockfishes, larval anchovy, northern lampfish, and southern mesopelagics. Larval abundances of Pacific hake, Pacific mackerel and jack mackerel were also very high in 2024, while larval hake abundance was the highest in the time series.</h3>    <img src="Forage_S_ts_appendix-1.png" alt = "Image showing Forage South - CalCOFI survey: Mean abundance (ln(x+1)) index of the larvae of key forage species in the Southern CCE, from spring CalCOFI surveys during 1997 - 2024 (no data from 2020).
