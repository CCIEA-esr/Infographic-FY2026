    <h3>Marine conditions in 2025 were consistent with average survival for coho salmon returning to this area in 2026. Chinook salmon spend two years or more in the ocean, therefore for their return to the Columbia Basin in 2026, we look to conditions in 2024, which reflect a mix of poor and intermediate conditions. Quantitative models based on stoplight indicators generate outlooks for Chinook salmon returns in 2026 and 2027, and suggest predicted counts of Chinook salmon returning to the Snake and Upper Columbia rivers in 2026 will be lower than the 2025 returns, but close to the 10-year average. These models also suggest lower adult returns for smolts that went to sea in 2024 (most of which will return in 2026) than for salmon that went to sea in 2025 (returning in 2027). </h3>    <img src="salmon-columbia-modeloutputs-no-steelhead.png" alt = "Image showing Salmon, Adult returns - Columbia River: Observed (black lines) and modeled (blue lines) adult salmon counts at Bonneville Dam for spring Chinook salmon (top row), fall Chinook salmon (middle row), and steelhead (bottom row).
