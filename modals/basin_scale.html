    <h3>Basin-scale indices suggest average to above average conditions for productivity in 2025: the ONI was negative to neutral during the year, whereas the PDO and NPGO were negative during the entire year. The ONI remained neutral or negative, reflective of the mild La Niña conditions during the remainder of the year. The PDO remained negative for a 7th consecutive year, reflecting that sea surface temperatures offshore were generally warmer than onshore, even with the overall warmer than normal conditions both offshore and at times onshore. After reaching relatively low values in 2019 and early 2020, the NPGO has remained neutral to low, indicating that the general circulation in the CCE is weaker than average.</h3>
