    <h3>Across ecoregions, conditions within rivers were close to median levels in 2024. Maximum and minimum river flow patterns tended to follow spatial patterns in snowpack, with Columbia ecoregions slightly below average levels. Five-year trends suggested a latitudinal cline, with both streamflow indicators trending negative in the north.</h3>    <img src="freshwater-streamflow_north.png" alt = "Image showing Stream Flow North Ecoregions: Anomalies of 7-day minimum and 1-day maximum streamflow measured at 213 gages in three northern ecoregions (Salish Sea and WA coast, Columbia glaciated, and Columbia unglaciated) from 1990-2024.
