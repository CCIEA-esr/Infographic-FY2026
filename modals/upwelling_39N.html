    <h3>Overall, 2025 saw above average levels of total cumulative upwelling in the central region off of northern California(~39°N). The initial reduction in total upwelling was related to a delay in the upwelling season due to the influence of El Niño. However, during the summer there was very strong upwelling after the spring delay and an associated strong transport of nutrient rich waters to the surface (BEUTI index), suggesting favorable productivity in this region during the summer of 2024.</h3>
