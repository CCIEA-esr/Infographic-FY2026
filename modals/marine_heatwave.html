    <h3>The northeast Pacific continues to experience large marine heatwaves in surface waters, with 2025 seeing the largest (by area) MHW observed since satellite monitoring began in 1982. At the beginning of the year, coastal SST was average, but with a large lingering MHW farther offshore to the southwest. Between February and April, this far offshore MHW mostly dissipated, only to re-emerge in mid to late May in the same region, and was fully formed by July, during which time coastal waters were cooler than normal due to strong upwelling. During August, the offshore MHW grew dramatically in size, reaching its maximum areal extent of ~10 million km^2 on Sept. 10th, 2025. In early September, the overall average SST of this NEP region set a new record approximately 0.6 °C higher than the previous record set in 2019. This timing coincides with record air temperatures over land throughout areas of the Pacific Northwest. After September, as is typical for these recent MHWs, this MHW decreased in size and receded from some of the coast.</h3>
