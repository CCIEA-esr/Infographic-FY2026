    <h3>Blooms of the diatom genus Pseudo-nitzschia can produce domoic acid, a toxin that can affect coastal food webs and lead to fishery closures. In 2025, such blooms were again problematic for shellfish fisheries and marine life in California and southern Oregon. A major domoic acid event in the Southern California Bight developed in early spring 2025 and lasted more than three months, leading to a large marine mammal stranding event. This marks the fourth consecutive year that this region has witnessed such an event. Recurrent toxic Pseudo-nitzschia blooms in southern Oregon resulted in the razor clam fishery being closed for all of 2025. Humboldt County in northern California also remained closed to razor clam harvesting throughout 2025, and the fishery in Del Norte County was closed for the first half of the year.</h3>
