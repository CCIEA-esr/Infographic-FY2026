    <h3>Overall, 2024 saw average levels of total cumulative upwelling within the Southern California Bight (~39°N). The reduction in total upwelling was related to a delay in the upwelling season due to the influence of El Niño. Upwelling resumed in pulses after the spring delay, suggesting average productivity in this region during the summer of 2024.</h3>    <img src="Upwelling33N.png" alt = "Image showing Upwelling 33N: Daily estimates of vertical transport of water (CUTI, left) and nitrate (BEUTI, right) in 2024, relative to the 1988-2023 climatological average (blue dashed line) +1 s.d.
