    <h3>Overall, 2025 saw average total integrated upwelling in the north (Newport, OR; 45°N). Unusual this year were the strong pulses of upwelling before a rapid transition to downwelling during January and February, which repeated again in March, before transitioning to fairly average levels for most of the summer. The fall transition to a mostly downwelling state occurred in late August/early September.</h3>
